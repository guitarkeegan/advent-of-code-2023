## What is this?

This will be my first time participating in Advent of Code. The basic idea is that each day until Christmas, you have to solve a code challenge. I heard that it was also a good way to learn a new programming language, which is one of my main motivations. 

## Rules

I will not be using AI to solve the challenges, but I may use it to quickly lookup syntax.

## Three Languages

There are three folders. I plan to write solutions in Typescript, Go, and Rust. I am most familiar with Typescript, and I have written a few smaller projects using Go. I have been reading about Rust for over a year, but I have not taken the plunge to build any projects. So, I am excited to get to know these languages better by solving some tricky, fun problems.
